|	Set Up Instructions:
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

	Please take note;
	Before you begin installation it is very important that your server is configured correctly and has all the required source code dependencies.

		Ensure your error reporting is enabled on the server and you are logging the errors and not just displaying them.
		A error on install is a failure to adhere to setup instructions.
		If you experience a failure then a properly configured server will report that issue, no excuses required.

		1. Create a directory one up from root so it resides beside it not inside it, named bucket.
			Then inside the bucket folder make another and name it avatar.
			If you use your own names for those folders then you need to edit bitbucket.php and img.php defines at top of the files.
			Then add a .htaccess and index.html files into both newly created folders.
			Then chmod those above folders.
			Then extract pic.rar - javairc.rar and GeoIp.rar and ensure they are not inside an extra folder from being archived.
			Then upload the code to your server and chmod; 
				- cache and all nested files and folders 
				- dir_list 
				- uploads 
				- uploadsubs 
				- imdb imdb/cache 
				- imdb/images 
				- include 
				- include/backup 
				- include/settings settings.txt 
				- install/config.sample.php 
				- install/ann_config.sample.php 
				- logs 
				- torrents


		2. Create a new database user and password via phpmyadmin.

		3. Point to https://yoursite.com/install/index.php - fill in all the required data - then log in. 

		4. Create a second user on entry named System ensure its userid2 so you dont need to alter the autoshout function on include/user_functions.php. 

		5. Sysop is added automatically to the array in cache/staff_settings.php and cache/staff_setting2.php.

		6. Staff is automatically added to the same 2 files, but you have to make sure the member is offline before you promote them.
